              Sophrion was created to bridge this gap through an execution-first ecosystem designed for the future workforce.
              The ecosystem transforms students from passive learners into execution-ready contributors through AI-native
              workflows, collaborative production systems, startup-style execution culture, and deployable proof-of-work environments.
